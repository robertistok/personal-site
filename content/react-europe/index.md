I've recently participated in Paris at React Europe, a 2 days conference dedicated mostly to everything about React. 

---

### Draft notes

It was a great day today. I went out with an open mind and the goal of getting out of my comfort zone, talk to as many engineers as possible and learn a bunch of cool stuff. 

Before approaching someone, it felt weird and I felt anxious, however after the first 10 seconds, everything was fine all the time and I've met some great people. 

I recently read in a book(Dare to lead, the willpower challenge), that if you get past the first 10 seconds of awkward and embarrassing moments, the rest will be OK.

After the first hour, I started to feel comfortable with the game of approaching people, and during the following breaks, I tried to meet more people. And it became easier and it was so much fun.

I've met engineers from GatsbyJS, Contentful and TechAtBloomberg, just to name a few of the companies people were representing.

### The talks were great as well.

#### Day1

Learning about what is coming in React by Jared Palmer

Getting inspired by the React Spring guy about react spring and the cool animations you can do. No animation is better than bad animation, animation helps to guide the user.

Getting introduced to the concept of a backend for the frontend with MobX and GraphQL

Finding out about how to write high performant apps with React for Desktop by the guy who looks like Ignacz.

Automating the code review and code quality checks, performance issues by the Twitter Lite tech lead guy.

#### Day2

We learned about different techniques for the native platforms.

Relalized the importance of accesibility and how to make sure to actually do it all the time.

Traveled back in time to see where it all started.

Simplified the entry for new projects with the new version of next js; APIs, dynamic pages

Yarn2, no need to run yarn install, just need to push some zip files to git.

#### In general

Using types, animations are fun, react is booming, Reason, native apps

So much info, it is extrelemly demandind mentally.

After conferences, I get so inspired to code and contribute to open source. However, until now it did not last so much. But I have a feeling that this time will be different. Maybe because I started writing, but I feel a big urge to create and I believe this will also have an effect on my inspiration after the conference.
