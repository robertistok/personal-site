###   

Yes, that is a real thing.

But a lot of people still don‚Äôt get it. Most of the people assume that I don‚Äôt work if I am not in the office physically.

But that is far from the truth. Actually, I feel that I produce much more whenever I work online. The reduced number of distractions and having flexibility around my working hours make this possible.

### Why do you work remotely in the first¬†place?

Traveling is the biggest reason. After [falling in love with exploring in 2016](https://medium.com/@robertistok/solo-traveling-is-a-lot-of-fun-75be4ef8d234), I decided that I want to keep the dream alive, even when I am going to start working. There are so many exciting activities and places I want to experience, that a couple of weeks of holidays a year is not enough.

I am not yet sure where I want to settle down in the future. And I want to live in big cities(NYC, Hong Kong, Sydney, Rio, etc.) all around the world, but not commit to them for years. By working remotely, I will have the possibility to get a glimpse of the life there and move on if I discover that it‚Äôs not my piece of cake.

#### Spending time at¬†home

Being away from home means less time spent with our families. If you get a traditional job, that would mean using 2‚Äì3 weeks of your holidays just to travel home and spend time with your family. That leaves you only with 1‚Äì2 weeks for yourself, and that‚Äôs not a lot of time.

By working remotely I can enjoy the best from both worlds: live in exciting places and explore different cultures, but spend time at home as well. Since I moved to Sweden, I‚Äôve spent on average 6 weeks/year home and took only 4 days of vacation for hiking in northwestern Romania.

### Are you actually¬†working?

From the outside, it may look like I am on a constant vacation, as I like to move around a lot. In 2018, I‚Äôve spent more than 5 months outside of my current home base, Sweden, but took only 5 weeks of vacations.

But this does not mean that I cut back on work. On the contrary, I‚Äôve delivered quite a lot of exciting features and solved many challenging problems.

Through trial and error, I‚Äôve managed to implement techniques which help me to stay on track and don‚Äôt get distracted by the exciting things traveling has to offer. Finding a spot to work before arriving, getting a good night‚Äôs sleep and staying longer periods in the places are the most important ones.

There is something special about working from different places and countries which inspires me a lot. It might be the reward of exploring I get to enjoy after completing a task, being inspired by the new culture, the delicious cuisine, the desire to keep the dream alive or all of them combined. I don‚Äôt know yet, but I love it.

Coffeeshops, Airbnbs, co-working spaces, airports, airplanes, Ubers, buses, trains are just a couple of places I‚Äôve had the luck to call my office.

### What about collaborating with colleagues?

No matter if you are a freelancer, an employee of a traditional or remote only company or a business owner, working remotely will make you think twice before you ask for something.

Being in a different place or even another timezone will make most of your communications asynchronous. If you are not efficient with your communication, things will take double the time to get solved.

Working remotely has thought me to be more independent, respect other‚Äôs time, offer as much information as possible and the power of over-communication. Stating the same thing more than once helps to understand the situation from many perspectives and avoid confusion later on.

Not sharing the same space definitely makes things trickier, but not impossible.

### Final thoughts

I hope that now you have a clearer understanding of working remotely and why I want to do it in the long run.
