Having the opportunity to work remotely in the past few years opened up a whole new world for me.¬†

While in school with a lot of freedom, I always had the false assumption that growing up is equal to losing 90% of my time and flexibility due to work.

There is an other way though. By working remotely, I do not have to compromise the benefits of having a steady income with the freedom to do what I want.

### ¬†1. Flexibility

Working remotely allows you to do your work wherever you are, given that you have all the tools to make it happen.

You get to choose what to do with this. Travel the world or spend time with your family. You can also skip your commute completely if you decide to set up a home office and that is great. Imagine all the things you could do with the extra time you save yourself by not commuting for 1‚Äì2 hours every day.

You could also use this flexibility to explore the world and find the place which makes you the happiest.¬†

Even though Stockholm is an amazing place to live, I am not yet sure if I want to spend my whole life here. I want to see what's out there and the best way to approach this to experience different places.¬†

Spending 2‚Äì3 months in a place can give you a great overview of how does it feel to live there.

Personally, I like to use this flexibility to travel the world and spend more time with my family. There are just way too many places I want to experience and a couple of weeks of holiday every year makes this plan hard to achieve.

### 2\. Productivity increase

Whenever I work remotely, I see a big spike in my productivity. This comes from the combination of cutting out distractions, changing up my scenery and being "forced" to be more effective in communicating with my colleagues.¬†

Whenever in the office, it is so easy to ask something from my colleague, instead of trying to figure out first. This has the double effect of interrupting their flow and not thinking enough before asking.

While I am remote, I am much more attentive to this problem and I try to come up with a solution before asking. Even if I do ask something, that will be likely in writing and I want to be as efficient as possible with my message to avoid countless of back and forths.

### 3\. Possibility to choose where you¬†work

Working from coffee shops, from the couch or renting a desk at a co-working office. These are all possible options and you can choose which one suits you the best.¬†

Coffeeshops are my favorite place to work. There is something special in working from coffee shops which increases my motivation and focus. Having other people around me doing their thing, be that working, having a meeting or just enjoying themselves, feels inspiring.¬†

For example, oftentimes I start working in a coffee shop until lunchtime and then finish up working at my accommodation. Or the inverse. Or just spend the whole day at the same coffee shop. Or go to a co-working space. I like to change environments, based on how I feel and the type of work I am tackling.¬†

### Final thoughts

Of course, there are some caveats, which need to be addressed about working remotely. We are all different and what works for me, will not necessarily work for you as well. But to keep this post short, that is going to be a discussion for the next time.¬†
