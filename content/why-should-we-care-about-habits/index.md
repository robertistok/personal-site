> "Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going"‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJim¬†Ryun

For a long time, I thought habits can only be negative. Checking my phone first thing in the morning, procrastinating, biting nails, reacting instantly to notifications, scrolling mindlessly on social media, eating unhealthy food, and so on.

But no, this is far from the truth. If done wisely, the right habits will help us achieve extraordinary things in our life.

### What is a¬†habit?

> According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit), ‚ÄúA **habit** is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and **tends to occur subconsciously**.‚Äù

Habits occur subconsciously, without us thinking about it and this is their most powerful characteristic. Oftentimes we don't even realize that we have a habit, we run on autopilot.

This attribute could be a problem if we have destructive habits, but it is a great incentive to develop positive ones.

### Why are habits automatic?

If they would not be, we would not be able to survive. Imagine that you would need to think about every little detail of your life. Should I take a breath now or 5 seconds later? How to enter the house? What path to take to work? Is it good to drink water? What about sleeping, is it worth it?

It would be impossible to maintain a normal life if we would need to make decisions about **everything** _all the time_**.¬†**

By being automatic, habits save us a lot of time and energy, so we can focus on the things which actually matter.

### How do they¬†work?

To identify and develop habits, it is important to understand how do they work. Habits are composed of three different parts. For the sake of simplicity, let's decompose the bad habit of scrolling mindlessly through social media.

**1\. The cue  
**It triggers the habit. The tricky thing is that the same habit can be triggered by multiple cues. The more cues, the more times the habit will be triggered, which means its influence over our lives can increase dramatically.

In our example, the trigger could be waiting in line, being bored and/or waking up in the morning.

**2\. The action  
**When we find ourselves in one of the above-mentioned situations, the routine kicks in and we perform the action, in our case scrolling without a goal through the feeds.

**3\. The reward  
**Once we are done with the routine, we get a reward, which is going to reinforce the habit loop.¬†

Checking social media gives us a short term pleasure and dopamine rush, as a result, we feel good. This reward will keep us coming back the next time the cue is triggered.

Why the above-mentioned habit is a destructive one is a topic for another day. Check out [this article by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/06/30/a-run-down-of-social-medias-effects-on-our-mental-health/#6a59be632e5a) if you want to learn more about it now.

### Can we hack habits and develop positive¬†ones?

Absolutely!¬†

With time, perseverance and specific goals in mind, everyone is able to develop habits which will change their life.

Reading, exercising, learning, consuming healthy food, reducing time spent on the phone, being mindful, goal setting, planning are just a few amazing ones you could achieve with the right mindset.

The truth is that we need to be perseverant and need to walk the extra miles to develop constructive habits.

It will be extremely difficult to exercise every day if you've never been to the gym before, to read 50 books a year if you did not pick up a book in the last 5 years or wake up early if you usually sleep until 11.

Start with going to the gym a few times a week, commit to only one book/month or try waking up half an hour earlier.

The key here is to start small, show up every day and increase the intensity step by step. The chance of succeeding is much higher if you take a few steps forward every day, instead of running a marathon once in a while
