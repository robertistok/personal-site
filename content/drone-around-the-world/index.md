I was sitting in a coffee shop on a Saturday morning, trying to finish up an article for Medium. But actually, I was procrastinating on it, I did not feel to write, cleaning up my Facebook seemed like a more important idea.

IDEA: procrastination project

In retrospect, I am so happy that I did that. 

I wanted to spice up my feed a little bit, and part of it consisted of having inspiring drone pictures showing up in my feed about exotic places every day.

But I did not find any page I particularly liked. So I just created one. The idea was simple, go to Instagram, find gorgeous photos and share them on my Facebook page, with the credits to the original author of course.

On the other hand, I wanted to avoid curating drone pictures all the time, as that was not the goal of the idea. But if I want to see photos, I need to curate them, right?

That's perfectly true. And that's how I discovered that if you have a FB page, you can actually schedule posts, which will be automatically posted on your feed. That's great. I don't need to sit there all day and curate, I can just do it once and enjoy the process.

The process took long time… Describe the process here

One thing let to another, and I started coding. I wanted to make it simpler. And that's how drone-around-the-world was born. 

The story behind the tech and why do I think it is one of the greatest thing what happened to me was, deserves its own article.

Until next time.
